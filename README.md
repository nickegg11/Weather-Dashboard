Overview
--------

This is a weather dashboard app that allows you to search for a city and get the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast.



Description
-----------

The app is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple form to enter the city name and a clear button to clear the form. When the search button is clicked, the app queries the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather and 5-day forecast for the searched city. The current weather includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The 5-day forecast includes date, temperature, and humidity for each day. The UV index is color-coded to indicate the level of danger (green, yellow, orange, red). The app also saves the last searched city to localStorage so that the user can quickly get back to their last searched city.

The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CSS is built with Bootstrap and is responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The JavaScript is written using jQuery and makes API calls to the OpenWeatherMap API.
